# Real-Time **Chain Snatching Detection** using **YOLOv8**

 A deep learning-based surveillance project for detecting **chain-snatching incidents** in **real-time CCTV footage** using **YOLOv8**.

---

## **Project Overview**

Traditional CCTV monitoring depends heavily on human observation, which can lead to **missed incidents** and **delayed responses**.  
This project presents an **automated chain-snatching detection system** powered by **YOLOv8**, capable of identifying **persons**, **bikes/scooters**, and **chain snatchers** directly from surveillance footage.

**Key Capabilities**
- Real-time CCTV-based detection
- Fine-tuned YOLOv8s model with high accuracy
- Detects multiple classes: *person*, *bikes/scooter*, *chain snatcher*
- Ready for deployment on both GPU and CPU systems
